## The objective of pig game is to score 100 points before the opponent do.
### 1. Rules:
In each turn, a player rolls a die repeatedly until either a 1 is rolled, or player decides to **hold** and pass on the turn to its opponent. The number a player rolls (except the **number 1**) is added to a current score. 
If the player rolls one they lose their current score and the turn is passed to their opponent. 
If the player decides to hold, their turn total (temporary score) is added to the overall score.
Players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish. 
The first player to score 100 win the Game. 

### 2. Gameplay

As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations, including the use of two dice instead of one. Right now, this version is only a starter and uses only one single dice but I'am expecting to built a Commercial variants of two-dice Pig include Pass the Pigs, [Pig Dice](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11022/pig-dice)  , and Skunk.[](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3425/skunk)
